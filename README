== NFC Tools for Java ==

NFCTools is a collection of libraries and tools for NFC in Java. 
The targeted devices are desktop Reader/Writer and Android smart phones. 

Most functions in the library have been tested with a 
Nexus S running ICS and a ACR 122 USB NFC dektop reader.

The NDEF tag functions work with Mifare classic 1K and 4K cards and Ultralight/C (Type2) tags.

You can find a live Demo Applet using these tools and some YouTube videos at:

An online NDEF Editor using this library is also available at:

Please help support other tags and devices.
